## Emma Nisbet, Mengde Liu, Talya Jeter 

This project fine-tuned a ResNet-50 model for multi-class classification on MRI images that is robust to various ghosting directions. The model classifed 4 different categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. 

You can find all code for this project in ResNet50_Modeling.ipynb.
